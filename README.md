# OpenGL Renderer

This is sort of a frankenstein project. A playground, I might say. It's a typical 'renderer from scratch' project that I would try to improve over time.

Implemented:

1. Lighting (point lights, spotlights and directional light)
2. Model loader (mostly FBX-tested) using Assimp
3. The ability to load from embedded textures

**TODO**:

1. Skeletal animation
2. Whatever I will decide to add overtime.

Resources used:

1. LearnOpenGL
2. ogldev
3. Various books
4. Various forum posts from khronos and gamedev.net

UPDATE: I will no longer work on this project. Instead, for my frankenstein playground project where I learn more and more graphics techniques, I will be moving on to Vulkan full time.
